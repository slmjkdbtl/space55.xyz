- every button press and input should trigger some instant audio and visual treatment
- if your game has music, make on-beat interactions no matter what the game is about
- collectables is a must
- a burp sound effect should at least be triggered somewhere in the game
- no "no fun zone" - a 3 year old accidentally hit the menu button and don't know how to go back? then at least the menu screen should be fun!
